        <p>Have you recently gone to a movie in India and scratched your head trying to understand what was going on because of all the muted dialogues? For example, in a recently released Hollywood movie which was given ‘Adult’ rating, all double meaning dialogues were ordered to be replaced with 'Man and Woman', and all instances of the words 'asshole' were ordered to be muted.</p>
        <p>If you are tired of this ridiculous curtailment of the freedom of expression guaranteed in our constitution, there is a ray of hope. The union government has constituted a committee headed by Shyam Benegal, one of the most respected film makers in the country to recommend how to revamp the censor board. The committee is asking for views of film viewers on the certification process being followed by the CBFC and suggestions if any within the ambit of the existing Cinematograph Act, 1952, rules &amp; guidelines which have withstood the scrutiny of various courts to enable them finalize their recommendations. Submissions should be restricted to two pages and covering important aspects detailed here: <a href="http://www.nfdcindia.com/uploads/post/0241643001452855838.pdf">NDFC Guidelines</a>.</p>

          <p>Dear Sir,</p>
          <p>Following is the email regarding...</p>
          <p><strong>Certification vs Censorship:</strong></p>
          <p>Although CBFC has the term “certification” in it, it is still popularly referred to as a “censor” board. This is no accident. Despite the change in name the board is still actively trying to function as a censoring agency rather than a certification agency. This is an unfortunate reality which isn’t going to change overnight. It is ironic that CBFC certifies films and rather than being “responsive to social change” is actively hindering the process of social change by random censorship.</p>
          <p>The ratings of U, U/A, A and S, in principle, are mostly adequate. Most of the controversy is with the rating of A. A rated movies are meant for Adults and theaters are bound by the law to make sure all their viewers are adults. Enforcement of it should not be considered while certifying movies. Why does a movie, despite being rated A, need any significant cuts? Does the CBFC assume that adults living in India cannot make up their mind over movies? There is already a significant economic disadvantage to the makers when their movies are rated A, and yet the makers make a conscious decision to accept this rating for their movies because they want the movie to cater to a specific audience. CBFC should act as a conduit between the creators and the consumers, not as an iron curtain reinforced by bureaucratic apathy.</p>
          <p>CBFC should not rate movies twice(Celluloid and Video) unless there is a significant difference between the two mediums. A person should have the freedom to watch an A rated movie at the comfort and confines of his home. It should be the responsibility of the adults to make sure no child has access to them. CBFC should not act as a kind of “moral police”  and devoid adults from watching movies at the privacy of their homes. Restricting access to movies legally will only increase instances of piracy in this digital age as Indian movies makers are finding it easier to distribute their movies overseas without any restrictions/ censorship. Once the international versions hit the market, it is only a matter of time for them to be available on the Internet for the world to see. This is proving to be extremely burdensome to movie makers who are making movies that are being appreciated internationally and as an Internationally acclaimed creator being the chair of this committee should be able to easily empathize.</p>
          <p>The Anti smoking/drinking warnings and the “CGI” labels for CGI animals in movies should be thought over, especially when it comes to movies that are rated A. More than the smoking/drinking warnings, I do not see a point of having CGI prominently displayed when ever we see a computer generated animal on screen! I’ve read countless documents relating to this and cannot understand how this helps in animal welfare in anyway. Both these serve as severe distractions for viewers and hinders us from truly being a part of the cinematic world. There is also no standard way to display these warnings… Tamil movies have a white background with text over it where as most Telugu movies have transparent background with text and imagery.</p>
          <p>I attribute this to be a major factor why movie makers don’t make money outside of theatrical runs. When compared the US, India’s home video sales are abysmal(even including the income disparity) and rather than having more content included for home video, CBFC actively removes content.</p>
          <p>There are also severe restrictions placed on movies rated A banned from being aired on cable TV. To ease the burden on CBFC, it should be left to the devices of TV channels as they are adept at self-censorship. Indian broadcasters federation along with EMMC already have the necessary rules and mechanisms in place to make sure the programs they telecast conform to their respective guidelines.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, CBFC should certify all movies without ban
          ning them. They should treat movies as a form of highly skilled art form rather than an entertainment medium.</p>
          <p>In short - Certification for A rating should be much more liberal. Have a universal rating system for both celluloid and video(U, U/A, A and S). Let IBF and EMMC deal with monitoring content on the cable. Review the policy on smoking/drinking warning and the CGI labels(Does it really serve a purpose?).</p>
          <p><strong>The curious case of 50%:</strong></p>
          <p>The recent controversy regarding cutting a kissing scene from the new James bond movie “Spectre” illustrates this problem perfectly. This movie was rated U/A and the CBFC recommended 50% removal of a kissing scene. Would the CBFC do the same had that particular scene been twice as long? Doesn’t it give an impetus to movie makers to have even more of there titillating scenes on the assumption that at least 50% will go through the certification process? This whole process of hard limits on certain scenes defies logic. If CBFC doesn’t have a problem with kissing, why not accept the whole scene?</p>
          <p><strong>Digital age and Streisand effect:</strong></p>
          <p>What is the use of certification when the makers can directly release movies on online streaming websites which are based outside of India? CBFC need to embrace the digital age, not act as if it doesn’t exist. Take the case of Angry Indian Goddess, the movie creators released a video on social media showing scenes and dialogues that have been muted by the CBFC. Did the country collective outrage after seeing the video? This despite the movie being rated A.</p>
          <p>CBFC, as a whole, have been ignoring social media and this creates a perception that it is an exclusive club of grumpy old men who do not want the rest of the population to have some fun. A good leader can change that perception - unfortunately, the current chair and the board members are anything but that.</p>
          <p>The official website of CBFC is a perfect example of how out of touch CBFC is with modern technology. The fact that this notification could only be accessed via the NFDC and not via CBFC’s own paints a grim picture. The most recent news item is titled “Expression of Interest for 2nd Phase Computerisation of CBFC” posted in early 2012.</p>
          <p>Streisand effect is defined as “The Streisand effect is the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet.”</p>
          <p>One of the best illustrations of Streisand effect is the CBFC’s reaction to the song Sadda haq from the Hindi movie Rockstar. It was CBFC’s action that added fuel to the fire. Are we so insecure as a nation that we are so afraid of even showing flags and banners that may offend another nation. Censoring of these symbols managed to illicit even more strong reaction from people.</p>
          <p>CBFC is a perfect embodiment of the Streisand effect. CBFC has long been out of touch with reality and I am hopeful this committee will start taking proactive measures by improving their communication mechanism, being more approachable to the social media. Revamp the website and streamline the application process.</p>
          <p><strong>Spoilers:</strong></p>
          <p>Does your list of recommendations for cuts needs to be spoiler laden? Not only that, it is mandatory for theaters to display these prominently for people to see before the movie even begins. The minutia should be between the creators and the CBFC.</p>
          <p>with regards,</p>
